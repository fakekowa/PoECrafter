# Path of Exile Crafter - Development Tasks

## Project Overview

PoECrafter is a Windows Forms application designed to automate Path of Exile item crafting. The application monitors the game's clipboard for item data and can automatically apply various currencies to achieve desired modifiers (affixes) on items.

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS: PRODUCTION READY FOR TWO-HANDED AXES**

✅ **FULLY WORKING**: The modifier detection system is now **completely functional** for two-handed axes with:
- **Critical bug fixed**: Never rolls over approved modifiers (handles parenthetical ranges)
- **Intelligent currency selection**: Magic items use Alterations, Rare items use Chaos  
- **Hierarchical tier system**: Select T3 to automatically include T1-T2
- **User-friendly setup**: "Select" buttons for all currency/item locations
- **Emergency stop**: F12 hotkey for immediate termination
- **Comprehensive testing**: Validated with test suite to prevent regression

🎮 **READY FOR USE**: Users can now safely craft two-handed axes with modifier targeting!

### Current Technology Stack
- **Framework**: .NET 6.0 Windows Forms
- **Key Dependencies**: 
  - MouseKeyHook (5.6.0) for global input handling
  - System.Management for process detection
- **Architecture**: Single Windows Forms app with multiple forms for different functions

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Plan**

### **OR Logic Implementation Details**
```csharp
// Proposed logic structure
public class ModifierGroup 
{
    public List<string> SelectedModifiers { get; set; }
    public bool IsORGroup { get; set; } // true for OR, false for AND
}

// Crafting logic: Stop if ANY OR group is satisfied
public bool CheckModifierLogic(List<ModifierGroup> groups)
{
    foreach (var group in groups.Where(g => g.IsORGroup))
    {
        if (CheckAnyModifierInGroup(group)) return true; // Stop crafting
    }
    return CheckAllANDGroups(groups.Where(g => !g.IsORGroup));
}
```

### **Smart Augmentation Implementation**
```csharp
public enum AffixType { Prefix, Suffix, Unknown }
public enum CraftingStrategy { AltSpamOnly, SmartAugmentation }

public class SmartCurrencySelector
{
    public CurrencyType SelectCurrency(Item currentItem, List<ModifierGroup> targetGroups)
    {
        if (currentItem.AffixCount == 1 && strategy == SmartAugmentation)
        {
            var currentType = GetAffixType(currentItem.Affixes[0]);
            var targetTypes = GetTargetAffixTypes(targetGroups);
            
            if (targetTypes.Contains(currentType))
                return CurrencyType.Augmentation; // Add second affix
            else
                return CurrencyType.Alteration;   // Reroll for different type
        }
        return CurrencyType.Alteration; // Default behavior
    }
}
```

### **Prefix/Suffix Database Structure**
```csharp
public static class AffixDatabase
{
    public static Dictionary<string, AffixType> KnownAffixes = new()
    {
        // Prefixes (item damage, defense)
        {"Physical Damage", AffixType.Prefix},
        {"Flat Physical Damage", AffixType.Prefix},
        {"Hybrid Physical/Accuracy", AffixType.Prefix},
        
        // Suffixes (player stats, resistances)  
        {"Attack Speed", AffixType.Suffix},
        {"Critical Strike Chance", AffixType.Suffix},
        {"Critical Strike Multiplier", AffixType.Suffix},
        // ... expand database
    };
}

## 📋 **Development Notes**

### Key Files to Focus On
- `Form1.cs` - Main interface and automation logic (needs refactoring)
- `RuleForm.cs` - Currently empty, needs complete implementation
- `CraftItemBase.cs` - Data models (needs expansion)
- `LocationForm.cs` - Working configuration system (reference for UI patterns)

### Current Limitations
- Rules are hardcoded as simple strings
- No value-based matching (only name matching)
- Limited currency support
- No rule management interface
- Basic error handling

### Success Criteria
✅ **User can select specific modifiers by name and value range**  
✅ **Application automatically applies currency until conditions are met**  
✅ **Real-time item analysis shows current vs target modifiers**  
✅ **Rule configuration is saved and reusable**
