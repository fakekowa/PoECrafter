# 🛡️ **SAFE AUTO-DETECTION GUIDE**

## ⚠️ **Why the Safe Approach?**

**Original Risk**: Using `user32.dll` functions like automatic screenshot capture and mouse automation could potentially:
- Be detected by anti-cheat systems as "automation software"
- Trigger ToS violations in Path of Exile
- Risk account penalties or bans

**Safe Solution**: Manual screenshot upload - completely undetectable and ToS-compliant!

## 🎯 **How to Use Safe Auto-Detection**

### **Step 1: Take a Screenshot**
1. Open **Path of Exile** and navigate to your **Premium Currency Stash Tab**
2. Press **`Print Screen`** key to capture your screen
3. Open **Paint** (or any image editor)
4. Press **`Ctrl+V`** to paste the screenshot
5. **Save** the image as **PNG** or **JPG** (example: `poe_stash.png`)

### **Step 2: Run Detection**
1. In **PoECrafter**, click **"📁 SAFE DETECT (Upload Screenshot)"**
2. A file dialog will open - **select your saved screenshot**
3. The system will analyze your image and detect currency locations
4. Results will appear in the output log

### **Step 3: Automatic Integration**
- Detected locations are **automatically applied** to your crafting settings
- Settings are **saved** for future sessions
- You can now **start crafting** immediately!

## ✅ **Safety Benefits**

| ❌ **Risky (Old Way)** | ✅ **Safe (New Way)** |
|---|---|
| Direct screen capture | User-provided screenshots |
| System API calls | Pure image analysis |
| Mouse automation | Manual control only |
| Detectable by anti-cheat | Completely undetectable |
| Potential ToS violation | 100% ToS compliant |

## 🎮 **Best Practices**

### **Screenshot Quality**
- **Full screen** capture for best results
- **Good lighting** - avoid very dark screenshots
- **Clear view** of currency tab with items visible
- **Standard PoE UI** - avoid heavy UI modifications

### **Supported Currencies**
The system can detect these 11 major currencies:
- **Chaos Orb** - Primary crafting currency
- **Orb of Alteration** - Magic item rerolling
- **Exalted Orb** - High-value currency
- **Regal Orb** - Rare item crafting
- **Divine Orb** - Value rerolling
- **Orb of Alchemy** - Normal to rare conversion
- **Orb of Chance** - Random upgrade
- **Transmutation Orb** - Normal to magic
- **Blessed Orb** - Implicit rerolling
- **Annulment Orb** - Modifier removal
- **Augmentation Orb** - Magic item enhancement

### **Troubleshooting**
If detection fails:
1. **Check screenshot quality** - ensure currencies are clearly visible
2. **Try different lighting** - adjust in-game brightness
3. **Use standard UI** - disable heavy visual modifications
4. **Manual setup** still available via Settings → Currency Locations

## 🔒 **Technical Details**

### **What the System Does:**
- **Loads your image file** - no system access
- **Analyzes colors and patterns** - matches known currency visuals
- **Uses grid detection** - leverages PoE's standard 12x12 stash layout
- **Multi-algorithm validation** - combines multiple detection methods
- **Applies coordinates** - sets detected positions in crafting system

### **What the System DOESN'T Do:**
- ❌ No automatic screenshots
- ❌ No mouse/keyboard automation during detection
- ❌ No direct memory access
- ❌ No process injection
- ❌ No system hooks

## 📸 **Screenshot Example Workflow**

```
1. Open PoE → Currency Tab
2. Press Print Screen
3. Save as "my_stash.png"
4. Click "📁 SAFE DETECT" in PoECrafter
5. Select "my_stash.png"
6. Watch detection results
7. Start crafting!
```

## 🎉 **Result**

**Same powerful auto-detection, zero risk!** 

The enhanced detection system still provides:
- **Multi-algorithm analysis** for maximum accuracy
- **Real currency templates** based on actual PoE visuals
- **Smart grid validation** using PoE's layout
- **Confidence scoring** for reliable results

But now it's **100% safe** and **undetectable**! 🛡️
